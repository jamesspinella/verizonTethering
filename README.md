**UPDATE** 9/21/15
-------------------
Verizon/Apple seem to have patched this. I've only been able to retain Porthable Hotspot for < 1 week before it disappears. My best-guess is that Verizon now reaches out to iPhones to update Portable Hotspot authorization, whereas before (iOS 7 and iOS 8.0 days), Verizon would only reach out when there was a change to the iPhone's plan (add/remove 4G Mobile Hotspot feature).

Either way, check out this post for more info on how this hacked bundle works and how you could try your hand at making this work again (I've been unsuccessful and have essentially moved on to other projects): https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3due5f/tutorial_carrier_bundles_for_dummies/

================

About a year ago, I deciphered much of Verizon's Carrier Bundle type-mask system for iPhones, and used it to produce a tethering hack- the only 100% free tethering solution for Verizon's Unlimited Data holdouts.

Now that there's a CommCenter Patch for iOS 8, I was able to test this hack on iOS 8 - and it works!
