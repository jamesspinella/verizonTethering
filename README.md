verizonTethering
================

About a year ago, I deciphered much of Verizon's Carrier Bundle type-mask system for iPhones, and used it to produce a tethering hack- the only 100% free tethering solution for Verizon's Unlimited Data holdouts.

Since iOS 8.1 was recently jailbroken, I plan on testing the modified carrier bundle just as soon as I can. This hack depends on the CommCenter Patch from chinasnow.net, which has not been updated for iOS 8.x as of late. For reference, the CommCenter Patch for iOS 7 was released about two weeks after evasi0n 7 dropped last December.

If I had to fancy a guess, I would say that this modded carrier bundle will work on iOS 8, since nothing noticable has actually changed in the carrier bundle from iOS 7 to iOS 8.
