verizonTethering
================

About a year ago, I deciphered much of Verizon's Carrier Bundle type-mask system for iPhones, and used it to produce a tethering hack- the only 100% free tethering solution for Verizon's Unlimited Data holdouts.

Now that there's a CommCenter Patch for iOS 8, I was able to test this hack on iOS 8 - and it works!
