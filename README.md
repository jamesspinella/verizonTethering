verizonTethering
================

About a year ago, I deciphered much of Verizon's Carrier Bundle type-mask system for iPhones, and used it to produce a tethering hack- the only 100% free tethering solution for Verizon's Unlimited Data holdouts.

Since iOS 8.1 was recently jailbroken, I plan on testing the modified carrier bundle just as soon as I can (the jailbreak is "half-working" and no one can really use it yet).
