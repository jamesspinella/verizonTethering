Verizon iPhone Personal Hotspot Enabler
  Works for iOS 7.x and 8.x

This is a modified carrier bundle for Verizon LTE-enabled iPhones
(5, 5s, 6, 6+) to allow for Personal Hotspot without paying double
for your data plan ($29.99 for Unlimited Data + $30 for 4G Mobile
Hotspot). Most people these days have tethering as part of their carrier’s plan,
but many of us are still holding onto Unlimited Data (or even the $30/month 2GB plan), and who wants to pay twice for the same data?


Preflight Checklist
————————————————————
- Your iPhone must be LTE-capable (5, 5s, 6, 6+)
- Your iPhone must be Jailbroken with Cydia installed
— Your iPhone must also have OpenSSH+OpenSSL installed if you want to use SSH/SFTP to transfer the modified carrier bundle from your computer to your iPhone.

Notes
—————
- FTP will not work, it must be SFTP!
	- Username is “root”, password is “root”
	- For SSH, password is “alpine”
- Folders may be hidden… you can go to them directly, however.
	- The Verizon Carrier Bundle is located at /System/Library/Carrier Bundles/iPhone/Verizon_LTE_US.bundle 


Okay!
————
1. In Cydia, under Sources, add http://cydia.myrepospace.com/applelab/
2. Find and install “CommCenter Patch iOS8”
3. Respring.
4. Log into your My Verizon account and add “4G Mobile Hotspot” to your features. Make sure you select the correct device/line to add this feature to!
5. Reboot.
6. Use iFile, SSH or the SFTP client to backup your phone’s Verizon carrier bundle, located in System/Library/Carrier Bundles/Verizon_LTE_US.bundle
7. And replace it with the modified carrier bundle.
8. Reboot your phone and verify that it still connects to Verizon (usually just seeing “Verizon” in the top bar is verification enough).
9. Verify that you still have Personal Hotspot in Settings.
10. Reboot.
11. In My Verizon, remove 4G Mobile Hotspot.
12. Reboot for the last time and verify that you still have Personal Hotspot.
13. Enjoy not paying twice for your data!


Warnings!
——————————
- If you forget to remove 4G Mobile Hotspot from your plan, I am not responsible for any charges you may incur, and you *will* incur them (about $1/day prorated). So if you realize after a week that you never removed the feature, you’ll likely only be charged ~$7.
- If you “Reset Network Settings”, it will likely remove Personal Hotspot, and you’ll have to do this all again.
