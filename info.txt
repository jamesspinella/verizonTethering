Verizon iPhone Personal Hotspot Enabler
  Works for iOS 7.x
  To be tested with iOS 8.x

"The world's only 100% free tethering option for Verizon
iPhone owners holding onto their Unlimited Data plans"

This is a modified carrier bundle for Verizon LTE-enabled iPhones
(5, 5s, 6, 6+) to allow for Personal Hotspot without paying double
for your data plan ($29.99 for Unlimited Data + $30 for 4G Mobile
Hotspot).


Preflight Checklist
————————————————————
- Your iPhone must be LTE-capable (5, 5s, 6, 6+)
- Your iPhone must be Jailbroken with Cydia installed
— Your iPhone must also have OpenSSH installed if you want to use SSH/FTP to transfer the modified carrier bundle from your computer to your iPhone.

Okay!
————
1. In Cydia, under Sources, add http://apt.chinasnow.net/
2. Search for and install “CommCenter Patch for iOS 8” (Not iOS 7)
3. Log into your My Verizon account and add “4G Mobile Hotspot” to your features. Make sure you select the correct device to add this feature to!
4. Use iFile, SSH or the FTP Server to backup your phone’s Verizon carrier bundle, located in System/Library/Carrier Bundles/Verizon… (the only Verizon one.)
5. … And replace it with the modified carrier bundle.
6. Reboot your phone and verify that it still connects to Verizon (usually just seeing “Verizon” in the top bar is verification enough).
7. In My Verizon, remove 4G Mobile Hotspot.
8. Reboot your phone once more to verify that you still have Portable Hotspot sans the 4G Mobile Hotspot feature.
9. Enjoy not paying twice for your data!


Warnings!
——————————
- If you forget to remove 4G Mobile Hotspot from your plan, I am not responsible for any charges you may incur, and you *will* incur them (about $1/day prorated). So if you realize after a week that you never removed the feature, you’ll likely only be charged ~$7.
